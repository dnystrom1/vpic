# Vector Particle-In-Cell (VPIC) Project

VPIC is a fully relativistic plasma simulation code...

# Getting the Code

VPIC uses nested submodules.  This requires the addition of the *--recursive*
flag when cloning the repository:

    % git clone --recursive git@github.com:vpic/vpic.git

This command will check out the VPIC source code, including the Cinch
build system.  Cinch is documented
[here](https://github.com/losalamos/cinch).

# Requirements

The primary requirement to build VPIC is a C++11 capable compiler and
an up-to-date version of MPI.

# Build Instructions

VPIC uses the Cinch build system.  From a user-perspective, this is
equivalent to CMake.  To configure a build, do the following from
the top-level source directory:
  
    % mkdir build
    % cd build

Then call the curses version of CMake:

    % ccmake ..

**or, optionally:**

    % cmake -DENABLE_MPI ..

After configuration, simply type 'make'.

# Building an example input deck

After you have successfully built VPIC, you should have an executable in
the *bin* directory called *vpic*.  To build an executable from one of
the sample input decks, simply run:

    % bin/vpic input_deck

where *input_deck* is the name of your sample deck.  For example, to build
the *harris* input deck in the *sample* subdirectory
*(assuming that your build directory is located in the top-level
source directory)*:

    % bin/vpic ../sample/harris
